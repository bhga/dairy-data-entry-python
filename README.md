There comes a huge amount of manual work when it comes to data entry in excel sheets
This is a mini application a simple UI built in python to solve the problem of daily data entry for milk distributors.

Problem statement : 
Every day Milk distributors delivers huge amount of milk/dahi/chaas to local dairys. In Morning they delivery milk crate and at evening they go for money collection to each and every dairy they have delivered in the morning. Every Dairy orders different brand of XYZ milk. Now when the amount is received not every time you receive the sale amount as expected there remains some balance amount. So tracking correct calculation of per litre price i.e exepected amount for today and  amount that is received and calculating balance amount for today becomes tedious task when it comes to managing 50+ client and delivering 5+ different brand of milk/dahi/chaas. 

So i have created a simple UI from pysimplegui which allows users to fill the fields in more friendly way and leave the data entry part to python

I have used PySimpleGUI for UI and pandas to work with execl sheet 
I have used Dictionary and DataFrame to do all the transformation needed and further it should be easy to analyze data in excel sheet for non-technical folks
